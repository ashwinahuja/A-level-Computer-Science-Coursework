# A-level-Computer-Science-Coursework
This is all the code, report and associated materials of my AQA A-Level Computer Science Coursework, written while I was at St Paul's School.

The purpose of the coursework is to produce a complete system to connect people (generally the elderly for the purposes of the coursework) who require Technical Support and connecting them with teenagers in their area who can provide technical support. For this purpose, a WebAPI (in .NET Core) was produced to communicate with a MySQL server as well as a MessagingAPI and an Android App for the clients of the products.
